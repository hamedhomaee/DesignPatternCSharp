# DesignPatternCSharp
### A project for learning **Design Patterns** and practice them with simple examples. 

#### Until now, it has three main parts:
* Creational Design Patterns
* Structural Design Patterns
* Behavioral Design Patterns

#### Each folder contains its corresponding patterns. 

<p>All the explanations are extracted from GoF book and also a bunch of websites, which described the topic better.</p>
