<h1>Creational Design Pattern</h1>

<p>The Creational Design Pattern deals with object creation in a manner that is suitable to a given situation.</p>

<p>The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design.</p>

<br />

### What issue it resolves? 
<p>In real applications, the project is created with a lot of classes, which subsequently means: a lot of objects. If the creation of these objects are scattered on the client code, then it leads to a lot of complicated logic at the client code. The Creational Design Pattern helps to centralize the object creation logic.</p>

<br />

### Its patterns:
1. Factory 
2. Factory Method
3. Abstract Factory
4. Builder
5. Fluent Interface
6. Prototype
7. Singleton

<br />

<p>Apart from the above topics, "Lazy/Eager Loading" and "Thread-Safety" regarding these design patterns is discussed.</p>
